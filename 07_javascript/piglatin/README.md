# Pig Latin

Pig Latin is a not-very-secret secret language that many little kids
learn. Each word is translated by moving all the initial consonants to
the end of the word, and adding "ay" at the end. For instance, "banana"
is "ananabay", "clues" is "uesclay", and "apple" is "appleay".

Write a program that takes an English word as input (using the native
fonction `prompt`), and outputs its Pig Latin translation.

Again, each task should be assigned to a separate function, and each
function should include a signature and a purpose statement. Functions
should be tested using the native method `console.assert`.
