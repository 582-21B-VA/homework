# Homework 8: Legibility

Complete the following tasks. Pay special attention to the legibility of
your code: give meaningful names to predicates using variables, define
helper functions to describe the code's purpose, keep functions pure,
and align desired outcomes to the left edge.

1.  Write a function that returns, given an array of objects with the
    `name` and `age` properties, the age average.

2.  Write a fonction that validates a given string containing data. The
    fonction should return `true` only if the following conditions are
    met : the string is not empty, it starts with the word "start", ends
    with the word "ends", and contains at least 1000 characters.
    Otherwise the function should return `false`.

3.  Write a function that returns the primes (integers greater than 1
    that are not products of two smaller integers) up to a given number.

4.  Write a function that returns the number of unique vowels in a given
    word.
