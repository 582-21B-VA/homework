# Homework 10: Router

In a previous [exercise][recipes], you were asked to create a server
with resources about cooking recipes. Using the router we designed in
class, improve the server so that each endpoint is defined in its own
separate handler function.

**Important**: You cannot modify the `newServer` function.
